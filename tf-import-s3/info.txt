# Description of Terraform Workspaces
# A workspace in Terraform is an isolated environment for managing infrastructure. 
# Each workspace has its own state file, allowing you to manage different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) 
# without interference. Workspaces are useful for organizing resources and managing multiple instances of the same infrastructure.
